Just a test to see how easily I can make Super Mario Bros
using Python and Pygame.

Only the first level is to be implemented. Everything can be
found in the SMB.py source file.

I really only care about how the game plays, so it won't have
sprite graphics. Instead, I'll use simple rectangles to represent
game objects.
